## Project Overview

The PH University Management System is designed to streamline the process of managing university operations, including student, faculty, and admin management. It provides users with an easy way to manage their profiles, view academic information, and handle administrative tasks. The system also allows administrators to manage departments, faculties, and student records.

### Features

- User authentication and authorization
- Role-based access control (admin, student, faculty)
- Profile creation, retrieval, and management
- Department and faculty management
- Real-time academic information access
- Secure password hashing

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Md-Rijwan-Jannat/mongoose-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd mongoose-project
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

## Usage

### Development Mode

To run the application in development mode:

```bash
yarn start:dev
```

This will start the server using `ts-node-dev`, which enables live reloading on code changes.

### Production Mode

To build and run the application in production mode:

1. Build the TypeScript files:

   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```

2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   yarn start:prod
   ```

### Linting and Formatting

To lint the TypeScript files:

```bash
yarn lint
```

To automatically fix linting issues:

```bash
yarn lint:fix
```

To format the TypeScript files using Prettier:

```bash
yarn prettier:format
```

### Testing

This project doesn't have tests set up yet. You can add your own testing framework and write tests accordingly.

### Configuration

This project uses dotenv for environment variable configuration. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your environment variables there.

Example `.env` file:

```plaintext
NODE_ENV=development
